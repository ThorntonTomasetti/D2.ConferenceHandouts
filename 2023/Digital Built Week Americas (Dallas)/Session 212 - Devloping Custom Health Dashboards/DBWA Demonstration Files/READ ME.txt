There are 3 folders in here:
* Dynamo Scripts - contains 5 dynamo scripts to run on a Revit Model
* JSON Outputs - recommended folder structure for Dynamo outputs
* Sample Revit Files - modified Revit model used for the DBWA lab session example

The Revit Model Diagnostics is a Power BI report template developed by Thornton Tomasetti's CORE design team (formerly Digital Design). This report template was originally featured at the DBWA Conference in Dallas, TX in June 2023.

You should also find 2 Power BI (PBIX files):
* The 'Master Example' version is already filled in using data from the sample model 
* The 'Master Template' version is a blank template that can be modified and used with your own data

To load data into this template, please specify:
(1) the root folder where you store all JSON outputs of the Dynamo scripts (end your input with a \)
(2) the specific subfolder containing a set of JSON outputs from a specific run (no \ needed)

e.g. if a complete set of outputs is found at: C:\...\JSON Outputs\Project AA12345\20230115

then the parameter values would be:
source_path = C:\...\JSON Outputs\Project AA12345\20230115
source_subfolder = 20230115
